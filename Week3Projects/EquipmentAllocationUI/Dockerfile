# Step 1: Use a lightweight Node.js image for building the app
FROM node:16-alpine as build

# Set working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the app's source code
COPY . .

# Build the app for production
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Use a lightweight Nginx image for serving the app
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the built files from the previous stage
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
